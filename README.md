This is a simplistic web-app that enables users to log in and post stuff out to the web. 
It has categories available for users to add their posts to and enable it to work.
Currently, it is not deployed.
To run you need to have the path to the Postgres database (I am uncertain if other databases work) stored in the environment variable 'DATABASE_URL'
You can specify the port in the environment variable 'PORT'
To run the app locally, use the command python -m app after installing python and the requirements. (I think the requirements should be up to date)
